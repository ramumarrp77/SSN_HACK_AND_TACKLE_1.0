<h1>Women Safety</h1>

<p style="margin-top: 2vw;">
	India is known for its tradition and varied cultural heritage. Women are given respect
since ancient time. Gone are the days where women are restricted to stay inside houses.
Nowadays, we can see that women excel in all possible spheres of life. The mindset of the
people is more focused towards imparting western culture in day to day lifestyle. This
disrupts safety of women and places a major risk factor in today&#39;s modern world. The number
of death rate figures due to harassment against women increases rapidly. Women safety
should be taken seriously and the technology grip in protecting women should provide a
conducive atmosphere in brightening the future of women in all aspects. Some of the most
common crimes against women are given below:
<ul>
	<li>harassment at workplace</li>
	<li>dowry deaths</li>
	<li>kidnapping</li>
	<li>abduction leading to rape</li>
	<li>family problems</li>
	<li>assault on a woman</li>
	<li>trafficking</li>
</ul>
and so on.

<p>Can your idea supports safe guarding women and offers a helping hand in resolving
harassment issues and help in achieving a sustainable society?</p><br>
