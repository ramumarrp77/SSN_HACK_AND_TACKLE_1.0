<p style="margin-top: 2vw;">
Agriculture is the backbone of Indian Economy. The nation&#39;s growth begins with
agricultural prosperity as it initiates sustainable development of humanity. It helps in land
cultivation, providing basic raw materials to cater the needs of the society and breeding of
plants and animals. However, the problem of upbringing the standards in agriculture is
challenging due to less allocation of funds to farming and inadequate exposure to latest
technologies in improving its standards. Technological advances coupled with new financial
and environmental policies are the need of the hour. The rural development is left without
significant focus on its progress affecting the standard of living of farmers. Some of the major
contributing factors for decline in healthy yield are given below:
<ul>
	<li>poor quality of soil</li>
	<li>usage of non-permissible fertilizers</li>
	<li>improper rainfall during cultivation of seasonal crops</li>
	<li>non-identification of diseased plants at an early stage</li>
	<li>inefficient training to farmers</li>
	<li>mismatch in supply and demand cause</li>
	<li>strategies used in transportation</li>
</ul>
and so on.

<p>Can your idea maximize returns and lower risks in agriculture, or perhaps find a better
balance between production and consumption?</p><br>
