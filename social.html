<h1>Social Welfare</h1>

<p style="margin-top: 2vw;">
	The society where we live in has a mixture of different classes of people. It is
essential to meet basic human needs such as food and shelter. Government and other non-
profit organizations create schemes and legal awareness for citizens and residents of society.
This provides enlistment of backward community and differently able people. The
empowerment and improvement of social status of such people is the prime motto in the
planning and execution of all special initiatives. Some of the policies let users pin the issues
in a locality, gain support from the public, escalate the issues, and track the response of the
government/municipal body. It provides a platform for users to discuss on various aspects
related to social welfare policies in India. The following problems are prevalent in the society
	<ul>
	<li>poverty</li>
	<li>unemployment</li>
	<li>medical care to senior citizens</li>
	<li>women and child development</li>
