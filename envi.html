<h1>Hack and Tackle 1.0</h1>     
<h1>Environment</h1>

<p style="margin-top: 2vw;">
India has one of the fastest growing populations in the world. It’s far behind most
others when it comes to preserving the environment and the ecology. Our country is riddled
with a number of environmental concerns which have only aggravated in the last few
decades. It is high time we tackled these issues head on as turning a blind eye is no solution.
Neglecting the environment can create havoc and the damage done may become irreparable.
So we must wake up.
Some of the major environmental concerns India is grappling with today.
<ul>
	<li>Air pollution is one of the worst scourges to have affected India</li>
	<li>Rapidly depleting levels of groundwater is one of the biggest threats to food security
and livelihood in the country</li>
	<li>Increasingly tormenting heat waves in the past years</li>
	<li>Unrestrained use of plastics</li>
	<li>Garbage Disposal and Sanitation</li>
	<li>Loss of Biodiversity</li>
</ul>
and so on.
</p>
<p>We look forward to the younger generations of the nation to remain conscientious and act in
the best interests of future generations by providing ideas to improve the Environment.</p><br>
